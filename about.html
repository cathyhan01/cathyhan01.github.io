          <u>Full Name:</u> Cathy Han
          <br><u>Pronouns:</u> she-series
          <br><u>Education:</u> currently enrolled in UC Berkeley as a Computer Science intended major

          <p>I was born and raised in the Bay Area in sunny California. My childhood was marked with the frequent expeditions into the nearby outdoors with my family, and I distinctly remember the camera my father took with us to capture irreplaceable moments that unfolded.</p>

          <p>That was when my interest in photography was piqued, and throughout high school I casually took photos of subjects that interested me. This ranged from landscapes to portraits to still life. My work now currently focuses on but is not limited to portraits and candids. What really draws me in to reaching for my camera is the ability to storytell and frame a special meaning out of seemingly mundane instances in life. I hope these meanings will serve to inspire people to take a moment in their day and slow down, and fully take in their surroundings with an open mind.</p>

          <p><i>And that's where the meaning and name of my portfolio is derived from: an ache for euphoria, <u>euphoriache</u>.</i></p>
